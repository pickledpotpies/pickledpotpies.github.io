        <!-- Founding Flush Section -->
        <dt>Founding Flush</dt>
            <dd>Flush Factory Inc was founded all the way back in 1985. Our CEO, Poe Celin began Flush Factory after being left unsatisfied with the quality of the toilets used in public spaces. He sketched out the first design for the TopFlush® and got to work. Once the design was made, he began searching for investors to build the first TopFlush®. After securing a $50,000 investment, the first ever TopFlush® began production. TopFlushes began being installed in homes, malls, schools, workplaces and restaurants all over America. With the TopFlush® Model One, Flush Factory rose to the #1 toilet seller of America in 1988.  Since then, Flush Factory has continued to innovate how toilets are made with our new TopFlush® Model Four.  </dd>
