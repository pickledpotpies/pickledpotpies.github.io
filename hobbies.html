            <dt>Why Manga is Imporant</dt>
            <dd>I've been a fan of anime/manga for many years. Although some people might think manga is just a comic, the medium of manga is able to bring out an entirely unique feeling compared to others.
            My all time favorite manga right now is "Goodnight Punpun" by Inio Asano.

                <dt>Why Music is Important</dt>
                <dd>Music is really important to me because it brings expression and creativity to the world. I am almost always listening to music whenever possible, whether its to help me focus or if I want to listen to an album.
                This is the greatest album of all time btw and if you disagree you're wrong. </dd>

                <dt>Why Art is Important</dt>
                <dd>I always have had a huge appreciation for artists, especially now with the rise of AI which directly harms artists. Although I don't draw much, art is VERY difficult. I am a self-taught artist. Drawing whether physical or digital, is a very unique medium that I find a lot of enjoyment in.</dd>
